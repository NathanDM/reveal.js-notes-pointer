A fork of [the default reveal.js notes plugin](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/master/plugin/notes) where you can use your mouse to point, as if with a laser pointer, in the notes preview window and have it show up in the presentation window.

Work in progress; it currently works, but isn't configurable at all.

Some inspiration from [`caiofcm/plugin-revealjs-mouse-pointer`](https://github.com/caiofcm/plugin-revealjs-mouse-pointer).
